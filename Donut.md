# Blender Donut Tutorial story
### Level1:
#### I completed Level 1 of Blender Guru's Donut tutorial on 7/7/2020.
#### I started with a Torus, or a ring-like object in Blender.
#### Then I made adjustments before going into edit mode, like reducing the vertices, and reducing the diameter of the inner and outer parts of the donut so the donut is an average donut diameter.
#### Next, I added a subdivision, to add more detail and lessen sharp edges when I morph my donut.
#### Next, I took my grab tool, and turned on proportional edtiting so that I morphed not just one vertex, but the edges and vertices of those around it, so that the donut felt more real and not computer generated. However, I pulled a bit too much on one side of the donut and made it a bit lopsided. I left it that way, it's a good marker that I can use when I rotate the donut.
#### Next, I used the border tool to select 1/3rd of the donut from the top, and duplicate it to make the icing. It also includes the subdivision modifier.
#### Then I added a Solidify modifier to make the top thick like icing. I also moved subdivision to the top, so that it subdivides and then solidifies.
#### After that I pressed alt-select(Left Click) to select one ring of vertices
